Signed variables-such as signed integers will allow you to represent numbers both in the positive and negative ranges.

Unsigned variables-such as unsigned integers, will only allow you to represent numbers in the positive.

Unsigned and signed variables of the same type (such as int and byte) both have the same range (range of 65,536 and 256 numbers, respectively),
but unsigned can represent a larger magnitude number than the corresponding signed variable.

For example, an unsigned byte can represent values from 0 to 255, while signed byte can represent -128 to 127. (Adding 128 + 127 = 255)[1]


To Print Hello when 'y' or 'Y' are given as input:
class check
{
public static void main(String args[])
    {
      char ar='y';
       while(ar='y'|| ar='Y')
         {
           System.out.println("Hello");
         }
    }
}

Greatest of two numbers without > or < symbols:

class Greatest
{
public static void main(String args[])
     {
       int x=34, y=27;
       System.out.println( ((x + y) +(x - y)) / 2);
     }
}
